# Bancempo Android App  - TimeBanking application

##Project description
Bancempo is an app which supports reciprocal service exchange, so, instead of money, it uses units of time as currency. 
It is possible to logging in using a Gmail account, so, as soon as you open the app, you are presented with the option to sign up, or if youâ€™ve already done so, to login using your Google account, making it very simple and convenient, no extra password to remember.
